# Miniature Image

A 1/7 scale figurine of a character from an unspecified "picture," rendered in a realistic style, made of PVC, and placed on a computer desk. It should have a round, transparent acrylic base without text.

Environment Details: The background should be indoors, and the computer screen should display the brush modeling process of the figurine.

Packaging Details: A BANDAI-style toy packaging box with original artwork and two-dimensional flat illustrations should be placed next to the computer screen. A model packaging box with the character printed on it should be behind the figurine.
